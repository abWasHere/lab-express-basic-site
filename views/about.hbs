        <p class="text">
            Arya Stark is the youngest daughter and third child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Ned Stark. <br>
            Arya was born and raised at Winterfell. She has an older sister, Sansa, an older brother Robb, two younger
            brothers Bran and Rickon Stark, and a "bastard half-brother" Jon Snow. </p>
        <p class="text">
            Arya rejects the notion that she must become a lady and marry for influence and power. Instead, she believes
            that she can forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of arms, and is
            bored by embroidery and other "lady-like" pursuits. She takes after her father and has a quarrelsome
            relationship with her sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and personalities. She is close to
            her "half-brother" Jon, who is also something of an outsider.
